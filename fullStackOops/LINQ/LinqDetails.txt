#LINQ (Language Integrated Query)

- It is uniform query syntax in C# to retrieve data from different sources and formats.
- It is integrated in C# or VB, thereby eliminating the mismatch between programming languages and databases,
as well as providing a single querying interface for different types of data sources.
- For example, SQL is a structured query language used to save and retrieve data from a database.
- In the same way, LINQ is structured query syntax built in c# to retrieve data from types of data sources such as 
collections, ADO.Net DataSet, XML Docs, web service and MS SQL Server.
- It returns results as objects.
- It enables you to uses object-oriented approach on the result set and not to worry about transforming different formats
of results into objects.
